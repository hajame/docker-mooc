## ex 2.11, My life with Docker-compose

This period, I have been containerizing [our groups' project](https://github.com/Hiipivahalko/Distributed-warehouse-system) for the Distributed Systems course.

We have two docker-compose files: one that uses a remote MongoDB, and one that uses a local one.

This course has taught me how to correcly set up the ports and volumes. Here I also learned that scaling is possible, and that since we've replicated only our backend worker node (no ports are exposed for external use), then there is no need to use nginx - the Docker DNS will take care of loadbalancing!

We have also done our configurations through a .env file. There are still some remnants of the old way of configuring, such as `MONGO_URI=${MONGO_URI}`, but we should get rid of those.

Another team member also added health checks and the autoheal node. I helped him sort out the correct ports so that the healthchecks work.

Here is the full `docker-compose-dev.yml`, which has the local mongoDB as well:

```yaml
